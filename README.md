# Modules

Those are tiny examples of how to use and create some C++20 Modules, with a simpler Makefile that just compiles every translation unit, and then uses them to create
the build. <br/>
This project shouldn't be used as best practices even on C++, Makefile or project management, It's just been created via Twitch on my Spanish [Twitch channel](www.twitch.tv/theApoCa) with the purpose of learning and teaching someting cool and new.

### Tecnologies

On this code I have been using some tecnologies just for fun:
- Modules (modules-partitions).
- C++ 20
- Templates
- Makefile
- All warnings enabled using [cpp_bestpractices](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cppbestpractices/blob/master/02-Use_the_Tools_Available.md) as reference.
